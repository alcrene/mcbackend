  McBackend is an abstraction of backends for storing MCMC
  draws. It encodes MCMC run metadata using protocol
  bufferes, and comes with various backend implementation
  such as an in-memory backend, or one for streaming MCMC
  draws to a ClickHouse database. The backends store not
  only MCMC draws but also sampler statistics, and are
  compatible with sparse data, or varying dimensionality.
  MCMC chains stored with McBackend can be queried directly,
  or convert to the popular ArviZ InferenceData objects.
